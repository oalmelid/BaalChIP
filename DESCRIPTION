Package: BaalChIP
Title: BaalChIP: Bayesian analysis of allele-specific transcription factor binding in cancer genomes
Description: The package offers functions to process multiple ChIP-seq BAM files
    and detect allele-specific events. Computes allele counts at individual variants
    (SNPs/SNVs), implements extensive QC steps to remove problematic variants, and
    utilizes a bayesian framework to identify statistically significant allele-
    specific events. BaalChIP is able to account for copy number
    differences between the two alleles, a known phenotypical feature of cancer
    samples.
